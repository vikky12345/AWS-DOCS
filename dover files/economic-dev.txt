    <strong>What is Economic Development?</strong>

    <p>Economic development is a policy intervention endeavor with aims of improving the economic and social well-being
        of people and supporting sustained economic growth. <br>

        Amartya Kumar Sen, an economist and philosopher, who received the Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences, once said: <br>

        <span class="ecnm-dest">“Economic development is about creating freedom for people and removing obstacles to
            greater freedom. Greater freedom enables people to choose their own destiny.”
        </span>
